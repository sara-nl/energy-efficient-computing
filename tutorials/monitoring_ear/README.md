<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

The Energy Aware Runtime (EAR) package provides an energy management framework for super computers. This tutorial covers the "end-user" experience with EAR.

EAR usage on Snellius can be decomposed into two "services." 

1. The EAR library (EARL): EARL is loaded (at runtime) when launching an application through the EAR Loader (EARLO) and SLURM plugin (EARPLUG). The EARL provides functionality to monitor energy (and performance) metrics of an application and additionally the ability to select the optimal CPU frequency according to the application and the node characteristics. 

2. Tools: Which include Job accounting (via the command eacct) which queries energy information of a particular job or list of jobs from the the EAR database (EAR DB) on Snellius.

### EARD: Node Manager
The node daemon is the component in charge of providing any kind of services that requires privileged capabilities. Current version is conceived as an external process executed with root privileges.
The EARD provides the following services, each one covered by one thread:

Provides privileged metrics to EARL such as the average frequency, uncore integrated memory controller counters to compute the memory bandwidth, as well as energy metrics (DC node, DRAM and package energy).
Implements a periodic power monitoring service. This service allows EAR package to control the total energy consumed in the system.
Offers a remote API used by EARplug, EARGM and EAR commands. This API accepts requests such as get the system status, change policy settings or notify new job/end job events.


<h2 id="EARL">EARL (the library)</h2>


The EAR Library is automatically loaded with MPI applications when EAR is enabled. EAR supports the utilization of both mpirun/mpiexec and srun commands.
To enable EAR in your job script when launching an MPI application you will need to include the following SBATCH options in your job script.

`srun` is the preferred job launcher when using EAR, as the EARL is a SLURM plugin! You will collect the largest amount of energy metrics when using srun
Running MPI applications with EARL is automatic for SLURM systems when using srun. All the jobs are monitored by EAR and the Library is loaded by default when EAR is enabled in the job script. To run a job with srun and EARL there is no need to load the EAR module. When using slurm commands for job submission, both Intel and OpenMPI implementations are supported. When using sbatch/srun or salloc to submit a job, Intel MPI and OpenMPI are supported.


### Example usage in a batch script

```
#SBATCH --ear=on
#SBATCH --ear-policy=monitoring
```

FULL example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
 
#SBATCH -p thin
#SBATCH -t 00:30:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=128
 
#SBATCH --ear=on
#SBATCH --ear-policy=monitoring
#SBATCH --ear-verbose=1
 
srun myapplication
```




<h2 id="tools">EAR Tools</h2>

EAR is available on Snellius as a module
```
module load 2022
module load ear
```
### Job accounting (eacct)
The eacct command shows accounting information stored in the EAR DB for jobs (and step) IDs. The command uses EARâ€™s configuration file to determine if the user running it is privileged or not, as non-privileged users can only access their information. It provides the following options. The ear module needs to be loaded to use the eacct command.

eacct example usage
The basic usage of eacct retrieves the last 20 applications (by default) of the user executing it. The default behavior shows data from each job-step, aggregating the values from each node in said job-step. If using SLURM as a job manager, a sbatch job-step is created with the data from the entire execution. A specific job may be specified with -j option:

Default: Show the last 20 jobs (maximum) executed by the user.
```
eacct
```
Query a specific job
```
eacct -J 123456789
```
Query a specific job-step
```
eacct -J 123456789.0
```
Show metrics (averaged per job.stepid) from 3 jobs
```
eacct -j 175966,175967,175968
```

### Application Characterization

EAR is not only a tool that will throttle CPU Freqs, but it also allows you to collect "traces" of your application, and characterize it. This is especially handy for large many node jobs, that often prove difficult to profile. In this way EAR is also a "light-weight" profiler for large applications.

The image below illustrates the usage of EAR to show the characteristics of a variety of multi-node CPU based applications side by side. This information can be obtained via the `monitoring` policy in EAR, and visualized with the `eacct` tool.

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

### 1. Monitor an application with EAR

Pick one of your own applicaitons, or use one of these .... [applications](https://github.com/sara-nl/energy-efficient-computing/tree/main/tutorials#applications)

### 2. Identify whether the applicaiton is CPU intensive or Memory/Communication intensive
